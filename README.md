# Blog

This is a blog. Posts are simply Markdown files named by date, and with the
title as a heading on the first line.

Site is hosted at [blog.deltaryz.com](https://blog.deltaryz.com). This site will
automatically both itself and its content from this repo, running `update.sh`
after pulling the changes.

Disclaimer: There was a point I honestly stopped caring about doing things well.
I have committed some atrocities here. It works, but, at what cost?
